# *react-around-api-full: My final project at TripleTen!*

This project consists of my first Fullstack application. It uses a Build version from the react-around-auth project for it's Frontend and integrates it to a fully working Backend Api for user authorization and data collection. 

The project also marks my first experience setting up and deploying an application to a Cloud server. It aquainted me to working with tools such as PM2, Nginx, Https protocols and Domain name registries to name a few.

## *Features*
Here are the App's main features on the Backend.  
(You can look into the [react-around-auth](https://github.com/frederickjodozi/react-around-auth) repository for information relating to Frontend features).

- An Index Route splitting requests between users and location cards endpoints.
- Controllers for both user and location card request using find, create, update and delete query methods.
- Middlewares for user authorization, request logging and validation and a centralized error handler.
- User and location card models using Mongoose Schemas.
  
## *Contributions*
This project can be used by aspiring Web developers and more specifically people looking to learn about Backend development using Express.js. It can be cloned on a local machine for studying and/or editing, and relevant pull requests will be accepted!

I am very proud of having finished this project, as it marks completion of the TripleTen Web Development curriculum. I am also thankful for the help TripleTen provided me with all throughout my learning journey!
